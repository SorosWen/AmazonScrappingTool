# Amazon Scraper using BeautifulSoup
This is a personal project as an extension of the 411 project in my portfolio. The purpose of this project is to explore functionalities of BeautifulSoup, not for any commercial use. 

There are two scraper in this project: 
1. Amazon product search page scraper: scrape all urls containing product information
2. Amazon product information scraper: scrape product name, price, rating, review from a product page. 

These two scrapers are used on both Amazon and eBay, as you can see while using this application. 

# Tools Involved
Python, Django, BeautifulSoup, HTML & CSS
